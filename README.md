## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

Based on the data, we notice that vehicle_length, spoiler_angle and AWD does not effectively impact the mpg of vehicle, but vehicle_length and ground_clearance does have a impact on mpg. The slope is not zero. Due to the variables in vehicle length and ground clearance.The R-squared value 0.71 which indicates that 71% will predict mpg values correctly. There are always more factors that can contribute to the MPG that can always be used to change that percent.

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

The design specifications state that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pound per square inch. all of the data frames created show that it meets the goal due to having 76.2 pounds per square inch

## T-Tests on Suspension Coils


We performed t-tests to determine if all manufacturing lots are different from the population mean of 1.500 pounds per square Based on our p-value, by looking at our p-value we do not have enough evidence to conclude that a significant difference exists.

## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition

The  metrics for our design should be cost, highway fuel efficency,In order to figure out the answer to this data, i would use a linear regression analysis to see the difference between our mechacar versus other brands of cars. the hypothesis is that there is a statistical difference between the variables and how they impact the vehicle.
