## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

Based on the data, we notice that vehicle_length, spoiler_angle and AWD does not effectively impact the mpg of vehicle, but vehicle_length and ground_clearance does have a impact on mpg. The slope is not zero. Due to the variables in vehicle length and ground clearance.The R-squared value 0.71 which indicates that 71% will predict mpg values correctly. There are always more factors that can contribute to the MPG that can always be used to change that percent.
